    "abstract": "<p>\nWe present a general decomposition algorithm that is uniformly\napplicable to every (suitably normalized) instance of Convex \nQuadratic Optimization and efficiently approaches an optimal \nsolution. The number of iterations required to be within <i>&#949;</i>\nof optimality grows linearly with 1/<i>&#949;</i> and quadratically \nwith the number <i>m</i> of variables. The working set selection can be\nperformed in polynomial time. If we restrict our considerations\nto instances of Convex Quadratic Optimization with at most <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> \nequality constraints for some fixed constant <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> plus some \nso-called box-constraints (conditions that hold for most\nvariants of SVM-optimization), the working set is found in linear \ntime. Our analysis builds on a generalization of the concept \nof rate certifying pairs that was introduced by Hush and Scovel. \nIn order to extend their results to arbitrary instances of Convex \nQuadratic Optimization, we introduce the general notion of a rate \ncertifying <i>q</i>-set. We improve on the results by Hush and Scovel (2003) \nin several ways. First our result holds for  Convex Quadratic\nOptimization whereas the results by Hush and Scovel are specialized to\nSVM-optimization. Second, we achieve a higher rate  of convergence\neven for the special case of SVM-optimization (despite the generality\nof our approach). Third, our analysis is technically\nsimpler.\n</p><p>\nWe prove furthermore that the strategy for working set selection which \nis based on rate certifying sets coincides with a strategy which is \nbased on a so-called \"sparse witness of sub-optimality\". Viewed from this \nperspective, our main result improves on convergence results \nby List and Simon (2004) and Simon (2004) by providing convergence rates \n(and by holding under more general conditions). \n</p>",
