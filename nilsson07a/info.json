    "abstract": "We analyze two different feature selection problems: finding a minimal\nfeature set optimal for classification (<small>MINIMAL-OPTIMAL</small>)\n<i>vs.</i>  finding all features relevant to the target variable\n(<small>ALL-RELEVANT</small>).  The latter problem is motivated by recent\napplications within bioinformatics, particularly gene expression\nanalysis.  For both problems, we identify classes of data\ndistributions for which there exist consistent, polynomial-time\nalgorithms.  We also prove that <small>ALL-RELEVANT</small> is much harder\nthan <small>MINIMAL-OPTIMAL</small> and propose two consistent,\npolynomial-time algorithms.  We argue that the distribution classes\nconsidered are reasonable in many practical cases, so that our results\nsimplify feature selection in a wide range of machine learning tasks.",
