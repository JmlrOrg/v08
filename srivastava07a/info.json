    "abstract": "Quadratic discriminant analysis is a common tool for classification,\nbut estimation of the Gaussian parameters can be ill-posed. This\npaper contains theoretical and algorithmic contributions to Bayesian\nestimation for quadratic discriminant analysis. A distribution-based\nBayesian classifier is derived using information geometry. Using a\ncalculus of variations approach to define a functional Bregman\ndivergence for distributions, it is shown that the Bayesian\ndistribution-based classifier that minimizes the expected Bregman\ndivergence of each class conditional distribution also minimizes the\nexpected misclassification cost. A series approximation is used to\nrelate regularized discriminant analysis to Bayesian discriminant\nanalysis. A new Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classifier\nis proposed where the prior is defined using a coarse estimate of\nthe covariance based on the training data; this classifier is termed\nBDA7. Results on benchmark data sets and simulations show that BDA7\nperformance is competitive with, and in some cases significantly\nbetter than, regularized quadratic discriminant analysis and the\ncross-validated Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classifier\nQuadratic Bayes.",
