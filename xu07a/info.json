    "abstract": "Motivated by  mathematical learning from training data, we introduce\nthe notion of <i>refinable kernels</i>. Various characterizations of\nrefinable kernels are presented. The concept of refinable kernels\nleads to the introduction of <i>wavelet-like reproducing kernels</i>.\nWe also investigate a refinable kernel that forms a Riesz basis. In\nparticular, we characterize refinable translation invariant kernels,\nand refinable kernels defined by refinable functions. This study\nleads to multiresolution analysis of reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspaces.",
