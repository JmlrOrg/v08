    "abstract": "Recently, Ye (2005) suggested yet another optimization criterion\nfor discriminant analysis and proposed a characterization of the\nfamily of solutions to this objective.  The characterization, however,\nmerely describes a part of the full solution set, that is, it is not\n<i>complete</i> and therefore not at all a characterization. This\ncorrespondence first gives the correct characterization and afterwards\ncompares it to Ye's.",
