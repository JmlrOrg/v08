    "abstract": "While kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been applied\nin many contexts, the convergence of finite sample estimates of the\nassociated functions to their population counterparts has not yet\nbeen established. This paper gives a mathematical proof of the\nstatistical convergence of kernel CCA, providing a theoretical\njustification for the method. The proof uses covariance operators\ndefined on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and analyzes the\nconvergence of their empirical estimates of finite rank to their\npopulation counterparts, which can have infinite rank. The result\nalso gives a sufficient condition for convergence on the\nregularization coefficient involved in kernel CCA: this should\ndecrease as <i>n</i><sup>-1/3</sup>, where <i>n</i> is the number \nof data.",
