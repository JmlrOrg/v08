    "abstract": "Binary classification is a well studied special case of the classification\nproblem. Statistical properties of binary classifiers, such as consistency,\nhave been investigated in a variety of settings.  Binary classification methods\ncan be generalized in many ways to handle multiple classes. It turns out that\none can lose consistency in generalizing a binary classification method to deal\nwith multiple classes. We study a rich family of multiclass methods and provide\na necessary and sufficient condition for their consistency.  We illustrate our\napproach by applying it to some multiclass methods proposed in the literature.",
