    "abstract": "Reducing the dimensionality of data without losing intrinsic\ninformation is an important preprocessing step in high-dimensional\ndata analysis.  Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is a traditional\ntechnique for supervised dimensionality reduction, but it tends to\ngive undesired results if samples in a class are <i>multimodal</i>.\nAn unsupervised dimensionality reduction method called\nlocality-preserving projection (LPP) can work well with multimodal\ndata due to its locality preserving property.  However, since LPP does\nnot take the label information into account, it is not necessarily\nuseful in supervised learning scenarios.  In this paper, we propose a\nnew linear supervised dimensionality reduction method called\n<i>local Fisher discriminant analysis</i> (LFDA), which effectively\ncombines the ideas of FDA and LPP.  LFDA has an analytic form of the\nembedding transformation and the solution can be easily computed just\nby solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.  We demonstrate the\npractical usefulness and high scalability of the LFDA method in data\nvisualization and classification tasks through extensive simulation\nstudies.  We also show that LFDA can be extended to non-linear\ndimensionality reduction scenarios by applying the kernel trick.",
