    "abstract": "In binary classification problems it is common for\nthe two classes to be imbalanced: one case is very\nrare compared to the other. In this paper we consider\nthe infinitely imbalanced case where one class has a finite\nsample size and the other class's sample size grows without bound.\nFor logistic regression, the infinitely imbalanced case often\nhas a useful solution.  Under mild conditions,\nthe intercept diverges as expected, but\nthe rest of the coefficient vector approaches a non trivial\nand useful limit.\nThat limit can be expressed in terms of exponential tilting\nand is the minimum of a convex objective function.\nThe limiting form of logistic regression suggests a computational\nshortcut for fraud detection problems.",
